ROSBAG SLAM TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE - QUICK SUMMARY
==================================================
Test Date: 2026-01-11

TEST RESULTS:
[✓] Step 1: Generate Synthetic Rosbag - SUCCESS
    - Fixed storage format issue (mcap → sqlite3)
    - Generated 14 MB bag with 16,982 messages
    - Duration: 115.6 seconds
    - Topics: /scan, /odom, /tf, /tf_static

[✓] Step 2: Verify Rosbag - SUCCESS
    - All topics verified present
    - Message counts appropriate
    - No corruption detected

[~] Step 3: Test SLAM - PARTIAL SUCCESS
    - SLAM toolbox launched successfully
    - Bag playback completed
    - Processing occurred (568 KB logs)
    - Map saving FAILED (critical issue)
    - Output recording FAILED

[✗] Step 4: Analyze Map Quality - SKIPPED
    - Cannot run without map files
    - Analysis script ready but untested

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Map saving fails - "Failed to spin map subscription"
   → SLAM node terminates before map_saver can subscribe
   
2. SLAM output recording produces empty bag
   → Recording process fails silently

3. Synthetic publisher duration control broken
   → Runs 115s instead of requested 30s

RECOMMENDED FIXES:
- Priority 1: Fix map saving timing/lifecycle
- Priority 2: Debug output recording failure
- Priority 3: Add automated validation checks

FILES MODIFIED:
- generate_test_bag.sh (line 98: mcap → sqlite3)
