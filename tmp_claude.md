OK so given like localization attempt and everything I wanna understand how I can tell this robot how to navigate from different waypoints so am I able to create multiple waypoints on this map and also please let me know how I can use the existing cartography attempt folder code and Then load that map and add waypoints to it and then save it again as a new map and then load that into the localization attempt type of code and then have it figure out where it's at on the map with waypoints relative to it. And then I want to understand how to do like actual navigation between waypoints like just use a super simple path finding algorithm and plot all the points that I would need to navigate to between the weight points. Are you able to test this automatically Because I would just want you to add waypoints almost at random along the map like let's say add three different way points and call them office 1 office 2 office 3 and then figure out how to export the map with the waypoints and the text labels assigned to the waypoints and keep everything. Does this all make sense?
