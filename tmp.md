OK great so I ran start all SH but then I got an error and then when I move the lidar around the map would not update Like I could see pink outlines moving correctly where it was the edges but then like the white particles or something wouldn't properly update to fill in the map. I made a TMP dot log on the remote server in the scripts directory for this cartography attempt. So please can you help me understand what might be going on and update code accordingly.
