Students and faculty in the Department of Electrical, Computer, Software, and Systems Engineering are some of the more prolific researchers in the Embry-Riddle family. The department's research expenditures are nearly one-half those of the entire College of Engineering, with support from federal agencies including NSF, FAA, and NOAA as well as industry partners. The department is heavily involved in projects managed by ERAU's NEAR Lab and by the COE's Eagle Flight Research Center.

Strategic department research directions include three areas critical for the future of aerospace. These are:

Detect and avoid technologies for unmanned aircraft systems;

Assured systems for aerospace, including cybersecurity and development assurance;

Modeling and simulation for aviation and aerospace.

Detect and avoid technologies enable unmanned aircraft systems to "see and be seen" by other aircraft and by air traffic controllers on the ground. Of particular challenge is detect and avoid of uncooperative aircraft, those aircraft that aren't equipped to announce their position either automatically or in response to interrogations from the ground.

Assured systems are those that are robust in the face of cybersecurity challenges, with assured development being system design approaches that yield assured systems without high overhead.

Modeling and simulation for aviation involves everything from the logistics of getting passengers onto aircraft to planning how to get all air traffic around predicted bad weather without upsetting arrival times and locations.

The overall purpose of this project is to inform rulemaking and standards development regarding potential Right of Way (RoW) concepts for manned and unmanned aircraft in the low altitude environment.

There are various RoW standards, which apply to specific types of UAS. However, there is ambiguity for other UAS and rules have yet to be developed for interactions between two unmanned aircraft or for UAS swarms. RoW rules impact UAS Detect and Avoid (DAA) requirements and the development of industry standards. This research project explores RoW for diverse UAS operations and make safety-based recommendations for consideration by FAA and UAS standards bodies. Our collaborators in this project are University of North Dakota and University of Kansas.

PI Daewon Kim

CO-I Eduardo Rojas

​This grant supports fundamental research on a radical transformation of additive manufacturing through digitally connecting machines, humans, and manufactured products.

This grant supports fundamental research on a radical transformation of additive manufacturing through digitally connecting machines, humans, and manufactured products. Additive manufacturing has enabled a new paradigm shift from conventional design for manufacturing approaches into manufacturing for design. A fundamental change in additive manufacturing is necessary as we enter a new era of intelligent future manufacturing beyond additive manufacturing. A promising solution is the convergence of wireless embedded sensors with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) data processes, which can transform the way people interact with manufacturing processes, factory operations, optimizing efficiency, and anomaly system detection that could provide critical information about evaluated components and systems. This project opens a new transitional door to perceptive and cognitive additive manufacturing, enabling true internet of things and digital twin, connecting devices and machines in factories with robots, computers, and humans, and every product we manufacture in factories. The grant will also support educational activities to upskill the manufacturing workforce, K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, and the public, significantly influencing diverse populations of all ages and backgrounds.

Transformation to cyber-physical production manufacturing demands advanced process monitoring through distributed sensing beyond the current state of digitally connected machines and robots collaborating with humans. This project seeks to enable unprecedented wireless fingerprinting and sensing of additively manufactured parts by embedding wireless sensors and performing predictive analysis and health monitoring using AI and ML techniques. This project proposes a holistic approach involving four core research tasks: 1) to study the effects of embedding sensors during additive manufacturing; 2) to design embeddable acoustic sensors and insert them during the manufacturing process to read physical parameters; 3) to prove that embedded passive sensor signals can be sensed wirelessly using millimeter-wave antennas, and 4) to quickly monitor and evaluate the state of manufactured products using ML algorithms. This project has the potential to enable next-generation cyber-physical production systems.

Efficient Management of Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

PI Shafika Showkat Moni

Most of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based security and privacy solutions for VANETs use pseudonyms where each vehicle gets multiple identities to improve privacy significantly.

Read more

Most of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based security and privacy solutions for VANETs use pseudonyms where each vehicle gets multiple identities to improve privacy significantly. A vehicle needs 720 pseudonyms in 24 hours and 262,800 pseudonyms in 1 year, according to the US-based SAE J2735 standard. Trusted Authority (TA) revokes all the pseudonyms assigned to a malicious vehicle and stores them in the CRL. However, the overhead of maintaining such a large volume of identities is overwhelming for traditional CRL-based solutions. In turn, it incurs a higher delay to update and broadcast the CRL periodically. We have designed a novel approach by leveraging the Cuckoo Filter to reduce the storage, computation, and communication overhead associated with the CRL in VANET. The cuckoo filter contains only one entry for all pseudonyms of a revoked vehicle, thereby minimizing the overhead associated with CRL verification. Our scheme also provides an efficient lookup operation for vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) in a Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) scenario.

This research project focuses on designing efficient privacy-preserving authentication schemes to reduce the communication and computation overhead related to authenticating entities in VANET.

Read more

This research project focuses on designing efficient privacy-preserving authentication schemes to reduce the communication and computation overhead related to authenticating entities in VANET. We have exploited Merkle Hash Tree and Modified Merkle Patricia Trie (MMPT) to overcome the performance limitations of the conventional approach of authentication, such as the ECDSA algorithm for efficient authentication of Road Side Units (RSUs) and Vehicles in VANET. A detailed security analysis is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our authentication scheme against message modification attacks, replay attacks, and message injection attacks. Performance evaluation also shows that the proposed scheme has a significantly lower authentication overhead than other related schemes.
