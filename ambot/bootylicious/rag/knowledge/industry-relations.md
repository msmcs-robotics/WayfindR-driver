The mission of the College of Engineering’s Office of Industry Relations and Outreach is to bridge the gap between academic and industry engineering, strengthening both sides. We seek to build partnerships that enrich the global aerospace industry by providing graduate programs that satisfy industry needs.

To achieve this, College of Engineering actively works to pursue relationships with industry for the purpose of providing students and faculty real-world problems to solve for real customers. Those industry relations form a key component for student career placement at graduation and also provide industry-experienced educators for the classroom.

The Office of Industry Relations and Outreach is under the leadership of Professor Glenn Greiner, who has been with Embry-Riddle for nearly 25 years. His research at the NASA Langley Research Center helped forge relationships between academics, industry and NASA followed by 10 years of consulting. Griner’s guidance in the creation of the Certificate of Study in Airworthiness Engineering program provided a unique relationship with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Aerospace Industries Association headquarters. This helped encourage its expansion to the Embry-Riddle Worldwide Campus online Master of Science in Airworthiness Engineering program.

Industry Relations works with aerospace engineering leaders to create degree and certificate programs to meet the educational needs of those corporations and their employees.

The following degree programs were born through valuable partnerships between industry and higher education:

The Certificate of Study in Airworthiness Engineering (CSAE)
is a unique 12-credit-hour graduate certificate program, initiated by Northrop Grumman Corporation, focused on the science and regulatory causalities of airworthiness engineering for air-system lifecycle certification. The CSAE is composed of four courses, each concentrated on different technical and regulatory aspects, initially pertaining to MIL HDBK 516, of achieving and sustaining airworthiness for an air-system. The CSAE curriculum is structured to address the professional educational needs of participants regarding the principles of airworthiness engineering, especially those who are engaged in the design, development, certification, production, operation, and maintenance of air-systems. Upon successful completion of each CSAE course, earned credit is recorded on an official master's degree transcript. Certificate credit may apply to a future master’s degree if the recipient so chooses. The CSAE program, expanded to include Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, is available to all engineers who have earned a bachelor’s degree in the field of engineering, mathematics, or physics with a cumulative grade point average of 3.0or better. Successful completion of all four courses over a 10-month period in sequence is required. This program has been expanded to a 30 credit Master of Science in Airworthiness Engineering (MSAWE) as online courses through the Embry-Riddle Worldwide Campus.

The Multidisciplinary Master of Science in Engineering (MMSE)
was conceived and designed by Embry-Riddle faculty and Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (GAC) engineers to address the diverse array of scientific and technical areas important to modern aircraft product development. This 30-credit graduate program focuses on research and development, and requires a nine-credit thesis as part of the degree completion requirements. The curriculum content is tailored to target analysis, design, development, testing, and program management skills critical to current and future Gulfstream business jet products, and in general for the aerospace community. It is available only to GAC direct engineering employees and is not offered to the general public. Eligibility for admission requires applicants have earned a bachelor’s degree in the field of engineering, mathematics, or physics with cumulative grade point average of 3.00 or better.
