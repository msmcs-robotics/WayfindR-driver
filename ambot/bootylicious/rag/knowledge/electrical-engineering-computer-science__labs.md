The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science is housed on the third floor of the Lehman Engineering and Technology Center, in the 340 suite (east side of the building, facing Clyde Morris Boulevard). State-of-the-art labs for the department's research and instruction are also, by and large, located on the Lehman third floor. Lab facilities, described below, support investigation into the breadth of the department's areas of interest: from radio-frequency electronics to development of safety-critical hardware/software systems.
