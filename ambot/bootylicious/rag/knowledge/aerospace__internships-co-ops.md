The Co-op/Internship program provides students with
practical experience
that reinforces the
theoretical concepts
learned in the classroom. The Co-op/Internship program aids in bridging the gap between student life and the world of work. This program combines students' academic and career interests with work experience in business, industry, government, or service organizations. Key elements of the Co-op/Internship program experience are:

Engineering work assignments in areas related to aerospace engineering.

Supervision and evaluation of performance by engineers.

Completion of learning objectives designed to relate aerospace engineering studies to the work world.

Cooperative Education/Internship offers many benefits to students:

Provides engineering work experience that is relevant to aerospace engineering and a student’s career goals.

Helps to define career goals so that more realistic engineering job choices can be made.

Establishes valuable professional contacts and broadens engineering job opportunities after graduation.

May provide income to help with college expenses.

Increases self-confidence and interpersonal skills.

Enhances motivation and classroom participation by relating academics to the work world.

Offers the potential to earn one college credit for every 100 hours worked, to a maximum of six credit hours per semester for undergraduate students.
Graduate students can earn one credit hour for each 200 hours worked, up to a maximum of three credit hours over the duration of their program of study.
The AE Department Chair, through the AE faculty Co-op advisor, determines the suitability of potential Co-ops/Internships. Credit for approved experience is awarded toward the required technical elective courses.

Eligible AE undergraduate students are those who:

Have a cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or higher.

Have completed 30 university or college credit hours; if a transfer student, have completed at least 12 credit hours at Embry-Riddle in addition to meeting other requirements.

Remain in good academic standing throughout their participation in the Co-op/Internship program.

Eligible AE graduate students are those who:

Have a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher.
