The
Department of Engineering Fundamentals
doesn’t offer degree programs; rather, the department provides the foundation for the degree programs offered by all of the other departments in the
College of Engineering
.

Freshman students in aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, computer and software engineering, and so on begin with the
Department of Engineering Fundamentals
and then transition into their degree-oriented work during their second year on campus.

Unlike many universities where foundational courses are likely to be taught in huge lecture halls, our student/teacher ratio is small and faculty members are enthusiastic and engaged, with a love for engineering and education that shows in the classroom.

Faculty members have focused their education and research not just on solving engineering problems, but also on how best to teach engineering. That translates into more hands-on activities and other forms of active learning that take students out of the lecture hall and into the lab. In this way, students get to put theory into practice.

This involves a variety of technologies, from the most advanced computing systems down to the most basic — popsicle sticks and straws. With an approachable, knowledgeable staff that are truly dedicated to encouraging success, students in this department get the best chance possible to move forward into their chosen fields with a firm footing in the basics they need to become great engineers.

Engineering Fundamentals Courses

EGR 100

Course Design

In this one-unit course, students will develop a fundamental skill essential for success in engineering — spatial visualization. Using active-learning techniques, students explore different techniques for representing and visualizing three-dimensional objects, including flat patterns, rotations, symmetry, cutting planes, volumes of rotation, surfaces, and isometric and orthographic views.

Semesters Typically Offered

Fall

Prerequisites

Enrollment in Aerospace, Civil, or Mechanical Engineering

Prerequisite For

EGR 120

Typical Time Allocation From Student

To perform well in this course, a student should expect to spend approximately three to four hours per week outside of class on homework assignments and research. Students will work in teams and are expected to meet outside of class to work on projects.

EGR 101

Course Design

EGR 101 introduces students to the engineering profession. Students will actively learn the design process by participating in two to three team design projects, typically focused on space or aviation-related systems. The different disciplines of engineering will be explored, especially those offered at Embry-Riddle (Aerospace, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Mechanical, and Software Engineering). The interdependency of these disciplines will also be explored through the design of systems that require input from several disciplines of engineering. Professionalism and ethics within the engineering profession are topics that are covered regularly throughout the course.

Semesters Typically Offered

Fall, Spring, and Summer B

Prerequisites

None, but it is advised that students be enrolled in mathematics at the level of Algebra and Trigonometry (MA 140/142) or higher. It is recommended that students be enrolled in Calculus I (MA 241) while taking EGR 101.

Prerequisite For

No classes, but it is a required first-year course for all engineering degrees. It is preferred that the course be taken during the student’s first semester at Embry-Riddle.

Typical Time Allocation From Student

To perform well in EGR 101, students should expect to spend four to seven hours a week outside of class, especially during projects. Students are required to work in teams and are expected to meet outside of class to work on their design projects. Typical sections of EGR 101 require, at a minimum, two design projects. Each student can expect to put in a total of 15-20 hours on each project.

EGR 105/EGR 105L

Course Design

EGR 105 and EGR 105L (lab) provide an overview of the math topics most heavily used in the core sophomore-level engineering courses. All math topics are presented within the context of an engineering application, and reinforced through extensive examples of their use in the core engineering courses. This course introduces the engineering analysis software MATLAB.  The objective of this course is to increase student retention, motivation and success in engineering through an application-oriented, hands-on introduction to engineering mathematics. The course will also focus on communication (written, oral), teamwork, self-regulated learning and professionalism.

Semesters Typically Offered

Fall, occasionally Summer B

Corequisites

MA 143 or higher math course

Typical Time Allocation From Student

To perform well in this course, a student should expect to spend approximately six to 10 hours per week outside of class on homework assignments.

EGR 115/EGR 115HYB

Course Design

EGR 115 introduces the student to programming computers. Beyond fundamentals, the goal of the course is to give students the tools and acumen to continue to develop programming skills after leaving the course. Students will discover solutions to problems that can be solved using a computer and learn to plan out the needed programs. Typically, students will produce about six to 10 programs per semester as well as a final project of their own design and creation.

Semesters Typically Offered

Fall, Spring, Summer A, Summer B

Prerequisites

Algebra and Trigonometry

Prerequisite For

None at this time; recommended for several upper-level courses such as Fluid Dynamics, Orbital Mechanics, etc.

Typical Time Allocation From Student

To perform well in this course, a student should expect to spend approximately six to 10 hours per week outside of class on programs, homework assignments, and research. A course project designed and created by the student is required. Each student dictates her/his own schedule for this project, but surveys of past students suggest that (in addition to other assignments) the student will spend about 30 to 40 hours on the final project over the course of about six weeks.

EGR 115HYB (Hybrid Version of EGR115)

The HYB designator indicates that this course will be taught in a hybrid delivery format. In the hybrid format, all face-to-face lectures from the traditional class sessions are replaced with online activities such as videos, quizzes, and self-exercise. Hybrid courses are best suited for students who are technically competent, self-disciplined, manage their time well, and are highly motivated. The workload is comparable to the traditional section, in that all students should put in daily effort to practice what the lecture/videos show.

EGR 120

Course Design

EGR 120 is designed to teach the student sketching and visualization skills that will be used throughout their academic years and their professional career. The student is introduced to CATIA, a CAD program predominately used in the aerospace industry. As much as possible, aerospace engineering principles, practices, and designs are incorporated into the course.

Semesters Typically Offered

Fall, Spring, Summer A, Summer B

Prerequisites

EGR 100; or a score of 20 or higher on the PVSTR.

Prerequisite For

ES 201, Statics

Typical Time Allocation From Student

To perform well in this course, a student should expect to spend approximately six to 10 hours per week outside of class on homework assignments, solid models, and research. A course project designed and created by the student is required. Each student dictates her/his own schedule for this project, but surveys of past students suggest that (in addition to other assignments) the student will spend about 30 to 40 hours on the final project over the course of about six weeks.

EGR 305

Course Design

EGR 305 is the course in which students learn the application and use of high-end computer-assisted drafting, design, and analysis tool (CATIA) to engineering challenges. This course take the introduction to CAD developed in EGR 120 and advances the students’ skills in the current modeling package available.  Applications of CATIA workbenches include: the product specification tree, knowledge-ware, parametric design, part and assembly design, modification, document release and control, final drawings, and changes.

Semesters Typically Offered

Fall, Spring, Occasionally Summer A or Summer B

Prerequisites
