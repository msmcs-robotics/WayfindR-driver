About the Program

This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program enables a unique collaboration between Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) and Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA). Over three years, selected students will engage in joint research tackling challenges in electrified aircraft through advanced thermal management strategies.

The program focuses on training the next generation of engineers in high-impact topics like phase-change materials and transcritical CO₂ systems, combining numerical and experimental approaches in an international setting.

Research Areas

Thrust 1: Passive Thermal Management

Focus on solid-to-liquid phase-change materials (PCMs)

Applications in motors and electronics for electric aircraft

Flow visualization experiments and GPU-accelerated modeling

Thrust 2: Active Cooling

Study of transcritical CO₂ (tCO₂) systems for heat removal

Includes compact refrigeration systems and heat exchanger design

Hands-on experience with high-fidelity simulations and experimental rigs
