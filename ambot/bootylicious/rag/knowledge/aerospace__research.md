The objective of this work is to create the basic science underpinning the structural testing and evaluation framework and control for deployable large spacecraft. Large space structures and those with high dimensional ratio between deployed and stowed configurations are extremely difficult to test on the ground. The AFRL’s Space Vehicle Directorate recently opened the new Deployable Structures Laboratory, or DeSeL, as evidence of a renewed interest towards these systems. DeSeL represents the state-of-the-art technology for on-the-ground experimentation of deployable systems. In particular, an active Gravity Off-Load Follower (GOLF) cart system is being currently developed, intended to have three degrees of freedom (attitude motion) which could foreseeably provide the capability for large low-frequency motions. The real capabilities of the GOLF system are yet to be determined, and this research effort will develop in parallel, assist, support and inform the development of this new facility at AFRL.

New testing and evaluation science to identify these systems’ behavior and control them, that are robust to large uncertainties in the structural dynamics are then needed, and the first time they deploy on orbit is the ultimate test.

We propose to obtain the objective by combining novel control and learning theory with ad-hoc experimental activities. The culmination of this effort will be a flight demonstration, where a CubeSat previously designed by the Advanced Autonomous Multiple Spacecraft (ADAMUS) laboratory will be modified in its design and perform autonomous on-orbit structural identification, control, and testing.

The flight demonstration will be based on measuring the natural frequencies, damping ratios and vibration mode shapes via excitation of the spacecraft, using reaction wheels on the main hub and potentially distributed small thrusters on the flexible bodies, emulating the configuration of the AFRL’s Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research Project (SSPIDR).

GNC Efforts in Support of the University of Floridas Research for the NASA Instrument Incubator

PI Riccardo Bevilacqua

Read more

The following tasks will be performed by one Ph.D. student and Dr. Bevilacqua (PI at ERAU), in support of the University of Florida’s proposal for the NASA’s Instrument Incubator Program (IIP):

Year 1:

Drag-compensation and test mass control design. Adaptive control combined with integral concurrent learning will be investigated to estimate, in real-time, the effects of drag on the spacecraft, to enable precise control of the test mass inside it. The PI has successfully used this technique for drag-based spacecraft formation flight, where online estimation of the ballistic coefficient of an unknown vehicle is critical.

Support for drag-compensation thruster mapping. Lyapunov-based thruster selection principles, previously developed by the PI, will be used to simplify the thruster mapping problem, and prevent the use of any numerical iterations, to ease online implementation. An additional step will involve exploring the possibility to use adaptive + ICL control to also estimate the thrust errors and their misalignment.

Year 2:

Spacecraft acceleration estimation based on S-GRS outputs. The test mass position and orientation are measured inside the sensor and the applied forces and torques on the test mass are known. How to use this information to optimally estimate the spacecraft acceleration and angular acceleration due to atmospheric drag remains a challenge. An approach based on a bank of Kalman (or Extended Kalman) Filters will be explored, possibly in iterative form, as previously done for spacecraft relative motion estimation by Dr. Gurfil at Technion and by the PI and one of his former students.

Year 3:

Support for hardware-in-the-loop testing of the control system at UF. The PI and the PhD student will support experimentation at UF, to implement the above algorithms in hardware systems. The PI has over a decade of experience in on-the-ground testing of spacecraft GNC systems.

Year 1-3:

Support for numerical simulation of the closed-loop system. High-fidelity orbital and attitude propagators will be used to test the algorithms developed. STK and NASA’s Spice will also be candidates for comparison.

A Machine Learning Based Transfer to Predict Warhead In-Flight Behavior from Static Arena Test Data

PI Riccardo Bevilacqua

The objective of this work is to combine high-fidelity numerical models with unique/ad-hoc experimental activities to strengthen basic science underpinning the test and evaluation framework for warhead fragmentation and fragments fly-out.

Read more

Warhead fragmentation predictions are based on either numerical simulations or static arena tests where detonations occur in unrealistic conditions (not flying). The first methodology presents many shortcomings: there is no agreement on the state of the art for simulations, and many tools ignore important aspects such as gravity, aerodynamic forces and moments, and rigid body motion of different shape fragments. Numerical simulations are also lengthy and cannot be used as online/on-the-battlefield tools. The experimental approach is also extremely limited, as it does not reproduce the real-world conditions of a moving warhead.

The objective of this work is to combine high-fidelity numerical models with unique/ad-hoc experimental activities to strengthen basic science underpinning the test and evaluation framework for warhead fragmentation and fragments fly-out. In particular, we will aim at combining the most advanced simulation capabilities with static experimental data, to obtain a transfer function predicting lethality and collateral damage of a given warhead in real-life conditions. Artificial neural networks and/or other machine learning tools (e.g., Random Forests) will be used to capture the underlying physics governing fragments dispersion under dynamic conditions, coming from NAVAIR’s Spidy software, and eventually combine this knowledge with real warhead characteristics, coming from the static test. This proposal is of high impact because of the existing gap in analytical tools to define and validate warhead fragmentation testing.

The broader impact (long term) of this work may be a software tool that the warfighter can use on the field to rapidly assess the effects of the arsenal at his disposal. This tool will be equally beneficial to designers and testers within the Air Force and the DoD in general.

Spaceplane Atmospheric Control and Fluid Dynamics

PI Riccardo Bevilacqua

The HSP-X1 is a next-generation hybrid spaceplane designed to operate as a reusable single-stage-to-orbit vehicle. This means it takes off like a conventional airplane, reaches orbit without additional stages, and returns by landing on a runway—all using a single integrated vehicle. Its primary mission is to transport payloads on the order of tens of tons to low Earth orbit (LEO) more efficiently and rapidly than traditional launch systems.

Read more

For example, the design envisions the capability to place approximately 15 tons into low Earth orbit—a figure comparable to cutting-edge projects such as Skylon—but with estimated operating costs that are a fraction of current ones (on the order of 1/50 compared to conventional launch vehicles). The vehicle is designed to be fully reusable hundreds of times, with turnaround times between missions of only a few days, shifting space transportation toward an “airliner” paradigm rather than a traditional “launch vehicle” approach.

Understanding the Coupled Dynamics of Particles and Wall Turbulence

PI Ebenezer Gnanamanickam

​This work focuses on understanding the coupled interactions between large and heavy solid particles, on a particle bed, and a gaseous (air) carrier phase turbulent boundary layer developing over the bed.

Read more

Part I –
The incipient mobilization of particles by the carrier phase is currently predicted by various measures of the mean shear of the carrier phase velocity field. However, there is increasing evidence that particle mobilization is an inherently unsteady process better correlated with the unsteady carrier phase eddies. The proposed work seeks to systematically quantify and understand these unsteady aspects of particle mobilization, particularly as a function of the energy and scale size of the carrier phase eddies. The proposed approach is to introduce flow scales of controlled energy and scale size into a turbulent boundary layer developing over a particle bed, while methodically characterizing the subsequent initiation of particle mobilization. The properties of the particles, namely the diameter and density, will be varied. As the carrier phase is fixed (air), the proposed approach will then describe the processes of particle mobilization as a function of not only the carrier phase eddy energy and size but also the particle Reynolds and Stokes numbers.

Part II –
Once particles are mobilized, they form a saltating layer adjacent to the particle bed and become two-way coupled with the carrier phase flow. This interaction, thus far has been reported as modifications to the carrier phase turbulence statistics. However, the exact nature of this interaction has yet to be studied in any further detail. Specifically, the scale dependence or the energy transfer mechanism of this coupled interaction has yet to be described. To study this interaction, it is proposed to carry out careful measurements of the carrier phase turbulent boundary layer in the presence of a saltation layer.

In addition, during the course of both parts of the proposed work, detailed, simultaneous measurements of both phases will be carried out, in a time-resolved manner, to describe the scale dependent characteristics of the underlying physics. This will involve establishing an instantaneous shear velocity that initiates particle mobilization as a function of particle properties as well as carrier phase eddy scale and energy. While studying the interactions during mobilization and after a saltating layer is formed, the goal will be to establish scale dependent energy transfer pathways between the carrier and particle phases. To this end, the primary measurement technique used to characterize the carrier phase will be particle image velocimetry (PIV), while the particle phase velocity fields will be measured using particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). These PIV/PTV measurements will use multiple cameras at multi-scale, providing a detailed description of both phases of the flow at high spatial and temporal resolution. Together these techniques will then provide unique multi-scale, multi-phase measurement sets that will capture the detailed interactions of the particle and carrier phase, leading to new insights into the physics of these interactions.

Understanding the Coupled Interactions Between Hair-Like Micromechanoreceptors and Wall Turbulence

PI Ebenezer Gnanamanickam

​This research focuses on understanding the interactions between turbulent flows and long (high aspect ratio), flexible hair-like microstructures or micropillars inspired by those encountered in nature. Some examples include lateral line sensors in fish, airflow sensors in bats and hair cover of animals such as seals and bats.

This research focuses on understanding the interactions between turbulent flows and long (high aspect ratio), flexible hair-like microstructures or micropillars inspired by those encountered in nature. Some examples include lateral line sensors in fish, airflow sensors in bats and hair cover of animals such as seals and bats. These structures perform several physiological functions such as balance and equilibrium sensors, flow sensors, flight control sensors, thermal regulators and water harvesters. Particularly, hair-cell sensors have such structures which in conjunction with the animal's nervous system forms a mechanoreceptive device i.e., they turn a force or displacement, in response to the flow energy, into a nervous system response. These structures that vibrate in response to the background flow are also important in energy harvesting systems. However, these interactions are poorly understood primarily due to the complexity of the underlying physics. Capturing this physics requires simultaneous, combined measurements of the micropillar motion and the flow velocities which are challenging. The proposed research will use advanced image-based flow diagnostic tools to measure in detail the interactions between arrays of these micropillars and the background flow. The planned outreach activities will target a group that is almost exclusively comprised of students who are under-represented in the sciences, while also being economically disadvantaged. The graduate student supported will be involved in outreach activities, inculcating a spirit of outreach into the next generation of engineers.

The interactions between wall turbulence and these micropillars occur in the following manner. Flow structures of scales spanning several orders of magnitude, present within wall turbulence, excites the response of the micropillars. The deflection or vibratory response of the micropillars will then feedback and modify the non-linear, background turbulence, resulting in a non-linearly coupled system. In addition, this interaction occurring at the wall can affect the entire layer resulting in a multiscale interacting layer. Of particular interest are energy transfer pathways between the micropillars and the background turbulence. To describe this coupled interaction and the associated energy transfer mechanisms, advanced diagnostic tools such as multi-camera, multi-resolution, mosaicing particle image velocimetry will be used to capture the dynamics of the background flow while simultaneously tracking the motion of relevant micropillars using particle tracking techniques. Together these tools will provide unique multiscale measurements that will elucidate the coupled physics, advancing fields ranging from physiology to aerospace engineering to non-linear energy systems.
