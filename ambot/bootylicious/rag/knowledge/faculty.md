The diverse faculty of the College of Engineering share a common mission of providing a world-class education to our undergraduate and graduate students, contributing to the academic body of knowledge in their respective fields, and producing solutions to industry problems.

Many faculty have years of experience in industry to bring to their classroom lectures and research laboratories. Six of our faculty are “distinguished” faculty, bringing decades of high-profile research and funding history to their positions at Embry-Riddle, where they are actively building new laboratories and student research groups to support a growing graduate student population and research-focused culture.
