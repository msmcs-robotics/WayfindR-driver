Retrospective Detection of Valve Sticking Events in Aircraft Engines Using Historical Sensor Data

PI Parham Ahmady Phoulady

This project seeks to advance aviation safety by identifying historical valve sticking incidents within piston aircraft engines through the analysis of sensor data, thereby contributing to enhanced maintenance practices and operational reliability.

Valve sticking — resulting from factors such as deposits, corrosion, or mechanical wear—may compromise engine functionality or precipitate abrupt failures, frequently eluding conventional inspection protocols. Such undetected anomalies pose risks to safety, elevate operational expenditures, and disrupt flight continuity. To address this challenge, the researchers will examine an extensive dataset comprising more than 3,000 hours of flight records from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s Daytona Beach and Prescott campuses. From this analysis, the principal objective is to develop an accessible analytical tool capable of delineating the occurrence of valve sticking incidents within historical data, thereby furnishing maintenance personnel with actionable insights into engine performance deficiencies. This tool will refine maintenance protocols, minimize superfluous interventions, and bolster aircraft safety while optimizing operational uptime.

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): A11L.UAS.97: Propose Right-of-Way Rules for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operations and Safety Recommendations

PI M. Ilhan Akbas

The overall purpose of this project is to inform rulemaking and standards development regarding potential Right of Way (RoW) concepts for manned and unmanned aircraft in the low altitude environment.

The overall purpose of this project is to inform rulemaking and standards development regarding potential Right of Way (RoW) concepts for manned and unmanned aircraft in the low altitude environment.

There are various RoW standards, which apply to specific types of UAS. However, there is ambiguity for other UAS and rules have yet to be developed for interactions between two unmanned aircraft or for UAS swarms. RoW rules impact UAS Detect and Avoid (DAA) requirements and the development of industry standards. This research project explores RoW for diverse UAS operations and make safety-based recommendations for consideration by FAA and UAS standards bodies. Our collaborators in this project are University of North Dakota and University of Kansas.

Novel Space Science Test via Adaptive Control and Integral Concurrent Learning Leveraging On-Orbit CubeSat Structural Identification

PI Riccardo Bevilacqua

The objective of this work is to create the basic science underpinning the structural testing and evaluation framework and control for deployable large spacecraft.

Read more

The objective of this work is to create the basic science underpinning the structural testing and evaluation framework and control for deployable large spacecraft. Large space structures and those with high dimensional ratio between deployed and stowed configurations are extremely difficult to test on the ground. The AFRL’s Space Vehicle Directorate recently opened the new Deployable Structures Laboratory, or DeSeL, as evidence of a renewed interest towards these systems. DeSeL represents the state-of-the-art technology for on-the-ground experimentation of deployable systems. In particular, an active Gravity Off-Load Follower (GOLF) cart system is being currently developed, intended to have three degrees of freedom (attitude motion) which could foreseeably provide the capability for large low-frequency motions. The real capabilities of the GOLF system are yet to be determined, and this research effort will develop in parallel, assist, support and inform the development of this new facility at AFRL.

New testing and evaluation science to identify these systems’ behavior and control them, that are robust to large uncertainties in the structural dynamics are then needed, and the first time they deploy on orbit is the ultimate test.

We propose to obtain the objective by combining novel control and learning theory with ad-hoc experimental activities. The culmination of this effort will be a flight demonstration, where a CubeSat previously designed by the Advanced Autonomous Multiple Spacecraft (ADAMUS) laboratory will be modified in its design and perform autonomous on-orbit structural identification, control, and testing.

The flight demonstration will be based on measuring the natural frequencies, damping ratios and vibration mode shapes via excitation of the spacecraft, using reaction wheels on the main hub and potentially distributed small thrusters on the flexible bodies, emulating the configuration of the AFRL’s Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research Project (SSPIDR).

GNC Efforts in Support of the University of Floridas Research for the NASA Instrument Incubator

PI Riccardo Bevilacqua

Read more

The following tasks will be performed by one Ph.D. student and Dr. Bevilacqua (PI at ERAU), in support of the University of Florida’s proposal for the NASA’s Instrument Incubator Program (IIP):

Year 1:

Drag-compensation and test mass control design. Adaptive control combined with integral concurrent learning will be investigated to estimate, in real-time, the effects of drag on the spacecraft, to enable precise control of the test mass inside it. The PI has successfully used this technique for drag-based spacecraft formation flight, where online estimation of the ballistic coefficient of an unknown vehicle is critical.

Support for drag-compensation thruster mapping. Lyapunov-based thruster selection principles, previously developed by the PI, will be used to simplify the thruster mapping problem, and prevent the use of any numerical iterations, to ease online implementation. An additional step will involve exploring the possibility to use adaptive + ICL control to also estimate the thrust errors and their misalignment.

Year 2:

Spacecraft acceleration estimation based on S-GRS outputs. The test mass position and orientation are measured inside the sensor and the applied forces and torques on the test mass are known. How to use this information to optimally estimate the spacecraft acceleration and angular acceleration due to atmospheric drag remains a challenge. An approach based on a bank of Kalman (or Extended Kalman) Filters will be explored, possibly in iterative form, as previously done for spacecraft relative motion estimation by Dr. Gurfil at Technion and by the PI and one of his former students.

Year 3:

Support for hardware-in-the-loop testing of the control system at UF. The PI and the PhD student will support experimentation at UF, to implement the above algorithms in hardware systems. The PI has over a decade of experience in on-the-ground testing of spacecraft GNC systems.

Year 1-3:

Support for numerical simulation of the closed-loop system. High-fidelity orbital and attitude propagators will be used to test the algorithms developed. STK and NASA’s Spice will also be candidates for comparison.
