American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)

AIAA is the world’s largest professional society devoted to the progress of engineering and science in aviation, space and defense. As one of over 190 AIAA student branches located around the world, the Embry‑Riddle branch enables students to participate in team-based technical projects, attend professional activities, take trips to local aerospace companies such as NASA and Piper Aircraft, network with students and industry professionals, and much more.

AIAA Design, Build and Fly

The AIAA Design, Build and Fly (DBF) competition provides students with the opportunity to apply aircraft design experience toward a specific mission in a team competition that takes place every year. Student teams design, fabricate and demonstrate the flight capabilities of an unmanned, electric-powered, radio-controlled aircraft designed to meet the mission requirements. The ERAU team earned 1st place in the 2024 DBF competition, with 100-plus teams competing. ERAU placed in the top three teams for three years in a row, from 2022-2024, which is unpreceded.

EagleCam

EagleCam is a student-led project in which a camera was designed to take the first third-person images of a spacecraft as it makes an extraterrestrial landing. The team includes students studying aerospace engineering, computer science, electrical and software engineering, and business. EagleCam flew on the Intuitive Machines Odysseus lander, which landed on the moon in February of 2024, making it the first university student-built payload on the moon. Due to the challenges of the off-nominal landing configuration of the Odysseus lander, EagleCam was not deployed as planned, but the project was overall a remarkable success and an invaluable experience for the students.

Embry-Riddle Future Space Explorers and Developers Society (ERFSEDS)

The Embry-Riddle Future Space Explorers and Developers Society (ERFSEDS) is the largest student rocketry club on campus, with a focus on designing, building and flying high-powered rockets. ERFSEDS has been diligently working toward successful launches, with Artemis attending Spaceport 2024 and launching their competition rocket. They have been developing a test vehicle to ensure a successful flight at the next competition. Project Prometheus has continued to both create and test their solid motors, testing three times in the past year in collaboration with Embry-Riddle's Aviation Maintenance Science Department. Currently, they are investigating new formulations to scale up to larger motors in the coming semesters. ACME (Advanced Composites Manufacturing and Engineering) has been experimenting with advanced composites manufacturing techniques and will fly their in-house components in the upcoming rocket launches. Project Kleos, ERFSEDS' rocket controls project, has finished prototyping their control system and is implementing it onto an airframe to fly this semester. Project Zephyr has been repairing their supersonic recovery system after its initial flight and are finalizing ground testing of the launch vehicle before flying their rocket this semester.

Experimental Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (ERPL)

The Experimental Rocket Propulsion Lab (ERPL) is a student-run organization dedicated to designing, building and testing experimental rocket engines. Students experience hands-on learning through a wide range of projects spanning solids, liquids, hybrids and flight controls. 2024 marked an exciting time for the Experimental Rocket Propulsion Lab (ERPL). Over the course of the year, ERPL assembled and tested its bi-propellant feed system, Draco. In November 2024, ERPL successfully hot-fired its liquid rocket engine, Juno, which produced over 300 pounds of thrust. This achievement is the first time in over a decade that a liquid rocket has been successfully tested at the Daytona Beach Campus and establishes Embry-Riddle among the top universities in the nation for rocket propulsion. Over the course of a year, ERPL performed six-plus major operations, most of which happened at Cecil Spaceport in Jacksonville, rapidly accelerating its rate of operations. Most of these testing campaigns were made possible through testing support at Cecil Spaceport in Jacksonville, Florida. Additionally, ERPL has been busy designing its new high-altitude liquid bi-propellant rocket, MOE, which will set the world record for the highest collegiate liquid rocket launch. Thanks to these valuable experiences, ERPL members have secured internships and full-time positions at companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, Firefly and more.

Experimental Jet Engine Performance (XJEP)

The student club XJEP serves as an outlet for ERAU students to gain hands-on experience in air-breathing propulsion and jet engines. The club, currently with over 150 student members, recently presented conference papers at the AIAA SciTech conference in January 2024 in Orlando, Florida. Student researchers presented work related to their design and testing of a novel afterburner and variable nozzle system for their JetCAT P300pro turbojet engine. The largest current XJEP project is Aether, which aims to create a jet engine from scratch and further expand to a family of engines. Research for the afterburner continues now that an actuating converging-diverging nozzle has been designed that achieves supersonic flow. At the same time, a recuperator is being designed along with Initium, a freshman-oriented project that has multiple smaller projects, such as a test cell, an electric ducted fan and a pulse jet. XJEP also got its first corporate sponsor, CFturbo, a turbine design software used in industry, enhancing the capabilities and training of members.

Embry-Riddle Orbital Research Association (ERORA)

The Embry-Riddle Orbital Research Association (ERORA) serves to lay the groundwork for future research in orbit using experimental satellites, providing students with industry-applicable experience for satellite design, manufacturing and operations. ERORA has several projects that focus on CubeSat design and deployment.

Embry-Riddle Search and Rescue Technologies (SARTEC)

The Search and Rescue Technologies Club (SARTEC) at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University provides students with hands-on experience in designing, building and testing UAVs for real-world search and rescue (SAR) applications. Open to students of all disciplines and experience levels, SARTEC fosters a collaborative learning environment where those new to aerospace engineering can gain foundational skills while more advanced students tackle complex design challenges.

The club’s current project focuses on a deployable UAV equipped with thermal imaging to locate distressed individuals, assess their condition and communicate with ground teams in real time. To enhance its effectiveness, SARTEC is also investigating how aerial SAR systems interact with ground- and water-based rescue operations, ensuring seamless integration between UAVs and other search and rescue vehicles.

In addition to technical projects, SARTEC engages in outreach through the National Engineers Week Egg Drop Challenge, RC aircraft flights and collaborations with the local elementary schools, providing a valuable platform for both learning and innovation in SAR technologies.
