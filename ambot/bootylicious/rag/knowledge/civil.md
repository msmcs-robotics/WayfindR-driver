Students who graduate with a
Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering
or a
Master of Science in Civil Engineering
from Embry-Riddle's
Department of Civil Engineering
do so with all the knowledge, confidence, and insight they need to make a significant impact in the field of civil engineering.

Civil engineering involves all the design activities that make the world habitable by humans — buildings, bridges, roadways, airports and the other structures we take for granted all required civil engineering to bring them to reality. The Daytona Beach Campus is perfect for hands-on civil engineering projects, such as the concrete canoe and solar-powered systems. By taking classic civil engineering design problems, applying an approach using space-age technology, and then constructing that solution in a team, students develop the entire spectrum of skills needed to understand the engineering design cycle.

Small class sizes, hands-on projects, and dedicated faculty mentoring provide the basis for a modern education in applying engineering approaches to an ever-increasing spectrum of problems as environmental concerns collide with the increasing needs for transportation infrastructure, particularly in the aviation industry. The Department also investigates the infrastructure needed to make other locations, such as Mars, habitable by humans given modern technology.
