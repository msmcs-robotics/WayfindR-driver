These programs are designed to allow well-qualified students to start a master’s degree while still completing their bachelor's, thus finishing both degrees in a shorter time. These degrees also allow for the crossing of disciplines — earning a B.S. in one field and an M.S. in another, which gives graduates a versatility and breadth of knowledge sought by employers in today’s job market. Students earn the B.S. once all requirements for that degree are met, while still working to complete their M.S.
