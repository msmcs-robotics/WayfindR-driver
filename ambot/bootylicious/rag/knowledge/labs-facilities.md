The administrative offices and five academic departments of the College of Engineering reside in the Lehman Engineering and Technology Center. Additional educational and project labs for the Department of Mechanical Engineering are in the nearby M-building.

In addition to traditional classrooms and laboratories for instruction and research, the Lehman Center offers computing resources and open workspaces facilitating collaborative development for interdisciplinary student teams. Hands-on learning and learning-by-doing are enabled through a variety of student-accessible laboratories with the tools for a complete engineering design-build-test project cycle. The third floor also features a fully functional Distance Learning and Lecture Capture Studio, for creating high-quality and effective learning modules to enhance teaching at all levels.

Research facilities for full-sized aircraft flight test and development are located on the south side of the Daytona Beach airport at the Eagle Flight Research Center. An additional research center, the
Next-Generation ERAU Advanced Research (NEAR) Laboratory
, is located on the airport property adjacent to the primary campus. Undergraduate and graduate students collaborate with faculty at both of these research centers dedicated to solving real problems brought forward by industry.
