ABET
Inc. (formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) is the recognized accrediting agency for college and university programs in applied science, computing, engineering and technology.
ABET
accreditation is assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards established by the profession for which it prepares its students.
ABET
currently accredits some 2,900 programs at more than 600 colleges and universities nationwide.

One component of the accreditation criteria requires each program pursuing accreditation to formulate Program Educational Objectives in consultation with their program-defined constituents. ABET defines Program Educational Objectives as “broad statements that describe what graduates are expected to attain within a few years after graduation.”

Another component of ABET accreditation requires programs specify Student Outcomes, which “describe what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of graduation. These relate to skills, knowledge and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program.”

ABET is committed to Continuous Improvement and all programs must assess and evaluate the extent to which their Student Outcomes are being attained and use the results of these evaluations for the continuous improvement of the program.

ABET requires that each program make available to the public certain information, namely their Program Educational Objectives, their Student Outcomes, their accreditation status and data on their student enrollments and degrees granted. This information is published at the program links provided above.
