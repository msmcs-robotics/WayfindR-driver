A Boltzmann Simulator for Porous Media Flows

PI Leitao Chen

​This project develops numerical simulations through parallel development of a Boltzmann model to capture and elucidate multiscale thermos-fluids behaviors in porous media, as well as the fluid-solid interactions.

Read more

​To accurately simulate porous media flow problem, a kinetic model based on the Boltzmann equation (BE) was developed. Two primary reasons justified the choice of a BE-based approach over conventional Navier-Stokes (N-S) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. First, the fluid flow within porous media often occurs in extremely narrow channels, representing high-Knudsen-number flow regimes. The Knudsen number (Kn), defined as the ratio of molecular mean free path to the smallest channel dimension, indicates that traditional N-S equations are physically inadequate for accurately describing these flow conditions. Conversely, BE-based models are well-established to yield physically accurate results for high-Kn flows. Second, from a computational standpoint, the BE inherently involves a simpler mathematical structure due to its linear advection term, substantially reducing computational overhead compared to the nonlinear N-S equations. This simplification significantly improves computational efficiency, especially critical for simulating flow within complex porous structures. To better capture the complex boundaries in porous media, a meshless discretization method of the BE has been developed in this project. This meshless approach entirely eliminates dependency on mesh generation, offering significant advantages in accurately simulating flow through porous media.

Project Haiti

PI Marc Compere

The goals of Project Haiti are to provide Haitians with clean drinking water, to expose our college students to another culture, and to give them a hands-on experience using their engineering skills to directly help people.

Read more

​

Many Haitians living in the tent cities after the earthquake deal with chronic intestinal sickness from contaminated water. Our solar water purifier is designed to provide clean drinking water for 500 adults per day.The Summer 2014 purifier will be installed at the Dayspring Missions orphanage in Croix des Bouquets area, a suburb east of Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. It will provide up to 6000 gallons of water a day with the water being used by the orphans, distributed to three local church communities, as well as being sold to the community to generate income and filter replacement costs.

This project is an ideal intersection of humanitarian aid and engineering. Our students designed and built Embry-Riddle's solar powered water purifier for delivery to a Haitian tent camp. They learned how to use solar panels, batteries, pumps, and filters to construct a purifier that runs entirely from the sun. Now that it is completed, our students have become better engineers and they have learned a global perspective and the satisfaction of helping people in a developing country.

Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion for ASV Situational Awareness

PI Eric Coyle

CO-I Patrick Currier

An investigation into strategies and techniques for maritime object detection and classification using visual and spatial data with an emphasis on sensor fusion.

Read more

This project focuses on enhancing autonomous surface vessel (ASV) situational awareness through the fusion of visual and spatial sensing, aiming to improve the detection and classification of objects in the surrounding environment. Such technologies have applications in patrolling test ranges, enhancing harbor security, and using ASVs as support vessels for manned operations. The research is structured around four main objectives: creating and annotating multi-modal maritime data for sensor fusion, developing accurate surface maps for navigation, applying machine learning techniques for robust object identification, and creating sensor fusion strategies for improved robustness. The team uses a custom data acquisition system, which was used to create the open-source ER-Coast dataset. This dataset includes Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), high-resolution cameras, infrared cameras, and localization sensors to capture coastal waterways in Florida, both day and night, across 36 sequences. A portion of this data has been made publicly available for future LiDAR semantic segmentation, image segmentation, and object detection studies.

Magnetically-Driven Ventricular Assist Device

PI Eduardo Divo

CO-I Christopher Adams

The proposed project brings together multi-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and mock circulatory loop (MCL) benchtop experiments to analyze the hemodynamics of a proposed Magnetically-Driven Ventricular Assist Device (MVAD).

Read more

The multi-scale CFD model combines 0D RLC (Resistance-Inductance-Compliance) chambers to simulate the effects of arterial, capillary, and venous beds coupled with a 3DCFD model of the main arterial system where the MVAD will reside. In addition, a benchtop MCL will be calibrated using vascular resistance elements and compliance chambers to validate the multi-scale CFD predictions. The MCL will be driven by a Harvard Apparatus pulsatile pump that simulates the ventricular output and the test-selection centerpiece will be the MVAD prototype. The MCL fluid will be water loaded with magnetically-charged particles (such as ferrous particles embedded in silicon spheres). A dimensional analysis will be carried out by matching fluid dynamics parameters (such as Reynolds and Womersley numbers) between the Multi-Scale CFD and the benchtop MCL. This will allow the numerical and benchtop analyses to be analogous even though they operate on different fluids (blood and water). The results of this study will serve as validation of the hypothesis that a magnetically-driven pump with no moving parts can serve to assist in the cardiovascular circulation and thus reduce the risks associated with mechanical assist devices such as thrombus formation and stagnation.

Investigation of an Injection-Jet Self-Powered Fontan Circulation: A Novel Bridge and Destination Therapy for the Failing Fontan

PI Eduardo Divo

CO-I Arka Das

This research effort unifies multiscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and mock circulatory loop (MCL) benchtop cross-validations to analyze the hemodynamic impact of an innovative palliative alternative: the Injection-Jet-assisted Fontan circulation.

Read more

A structurally normal heart consists of two separate pumping chambers, or ventricles. One pumps deoxygenated blood from the body to the lungs, while the other delivers oxygenated blood from the lungs to the body. Approximately 8% of all newborns with a congenital heart defect have only a single functioning ventricle (SV). These patients cannot survive without a series of staged palliative operations to ensure adequate blood flow to both the pulmonary and systemic circulations. The final step in this staged reconstruction is the Fontan operation. While lifesaving, this unique physiology directs systemic venous return passively into the pulmonary arteries without the need for a subpulmonary pump. This results in chronically elevated central venous pressure and reduced cardiac output. Over time, this non-physiologic flow leads to significant morbidity, including hepatic fibrosis, protein-losing enteropathy, and Fontan-associated liver disease. A 2018 study of 683 adult Fontan patients from the Australian and New Zealand Fontan Registry reported 20% mortality by age 40, with only 53% free of heart failure symptoms and 41% free of serious adverse events. Similar outcomes have been documented worldwide, with nearly half of the observed morbidity and mortality attributed directly to failure of the unique Fontan circulatory system. To address this growing clinical challenge, our team is developing a novel, surgically implantable Injection-Jet Shunt (IJS) as a passive support strategy for patients with a failing Fontan circulation. This approach challenges the prevailing paradigm that mechanical pumps are the only viable support option for this population. Our proposed mechanism utilizes an intra-corporeal, surgically feasible shunt that harnesses the patient’s own cardiac power to inject a high-velocity jet from the aorta into the Fontan conduit. This jet entrains ambient inferior vena cava (IVC) flow, facilitating momentum transfer into the pulmonary circuit and unloading proximal venous pressure, all without any external power source. Multi-scale CFD simulations have demonstrated that this mechanism can lower Fontan pressure by 3 to 4 mmHg while maintaining clinically acceptable systemic oxygen saturations. These encouraging in-silico findings are currently being cross-validated in-vitro using a dynamically calibrated MCL that replicates Fontan hemodynamics under both resting and simulated exercise conditions. To characterize the flow behavior and jet entrainment dynamics of the Injection-Jet Shunt (IJS), the experimental MCL integrates both Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Light-Induced Fluorometry (LIF) systems. PIV enables high-resolution quantification of velocity fields and shear layers, while LIF captures real-time oxygen transport in benchtop Fontan surrogates, allowing for the assessment of systemic flow distribution and entrained volume fractions. A Proper Orthogonal Decomposition trained Radial Basis Function (POD-RBF) interpolation framework is applied to reconstruct and enhance the spatiotemporal flow fields. This combined optical and data-driven approach enables detailed mapping of jet structure, entrainment efficacy, and pulmonary perfusion, supporting the optimization of IJS configurations for future clinical translation. If successful, the IJS may provide a low-risk, fully passive alternative to conventional mechanical support, potentially delaying or obviating the need for heart transplantation and improving quality of life for children and young adults with single-ventricle physiology.

Composite Wind Turbine Blade

PI Sathya Gangadharan

The world's primary energy needs are projected to grow by 56% between 2005 and 2030, by an average annual rate of 1.8% per year (International Energy Agency, 2012). Energy policy has confirmed the improvement of the environment sustainability of energy as a primary objective also though increasing use of renewable sources (Increasing Wind Energy's contribution to U.S. Electricity supply, 2008).

Wind energy research is being followed in the world as an alternative to fulfill increasing electricity power demand, United State Department of Energy is aiming to expand the wind power in the U.S. Currently, 15.4 GW of power are installed and operational, with an expected growth the U.S. wind capacity will be at 310 GW by 2030, representing 20% of the nation's power needs (Increasing Wind Energy's contribution to U.S. Electricity supply, 2008).

Research on composite wind turbine blade carried out in Embry-Riddle is described below:

FLUID-STRUCTURE INTERACTION AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY DESIGN ANALYSIS OPTIMIZATION OF COMPOSITE WIND TURBINE BLADE
Mission:

To maximize aerodynamic efficiency and structural robustness while reducing blade mass and total cost.
A multidisciplinary design analysis optimization (MDAO) process is defined for a composite wind turbine blade to optimize its aerodynamic and structural performance by developing a fluid-structural interaction (FSI) system. MDAO process is defined in conjunction with structural and aerodynamic performance of the blade which is divided into three steps and the design variables considered are related to the shape parameters, twist distributions, pitch angle, material and the relative thickness based on number of composite layers at different blade sections. Maximum allowable tip deformations, modal frequencies and allowable stresses are set as design constraints. Airfoil performance is predicted with 2D airfoils analysis, while 3D CFD analysis is performed by ANSYS CFX software. A parameterized finite element model of the blade created in ANSYS ACP composite prepost and used to define the composite layups of the blade. The results of the CFD and the structural analysis are used for the optimization process accompanied by the cost estimation to obtain a compromised solution between aerodynamic performance and structural robustness. For the MDAO process number of design of experiments (DOEs) is defined by G optimality method and a response surface is created. Sensitivity analysis is performed to observe the impact of input parameter on each output parameters for enhanced control of the MDAO process. Further, to improve aerodynamic performance of the blade, new design approach with modified Tip (winglet) and rotor section is studied and substantial improvement in power generated over high quality baseline wind turbine blade is presented.

A BASELINE STUDY AND CALIBRATION FOR MULTIDISCIPLINARY DESIGN OPTIMIZATION OF HYBRID COMPOSITE WIND TURBINE BLADE

Preliminary baseline finite element (FE) model calibrations and evaluations are developed to assist and guide multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) of a large-scale hybrid composite wind turbine blade. The weight, displacement, and failure index are compared and used for calibration purposes. In addition, a cost estimation model is calibrated for labor hour, as well as labor cost, material cost and total cost. Stability of baseline wind turbine blade against harmonic resonance due to rotor rotation is validated by finite element analysis (FEA). A MDO process is proposed using the calibrated FE and cost estimation models. The MDO optimizes multiple objectives such as blade length, weight, manufacturing cost, and power production. For this analysis, the turbine blade is divided into regions and the sequence of hybrid laminate layup for each region is considered as design variables. Extreme wind condition for rotor rotation and rotor stop condition is considered as the applied load on the blade. The designed structural strength and stiffness are demonstrated to withstand the loads due to harmonic excitation from rotor rotation. A process of design procedure for obtaining an optimum hybrid composite laminate layup and an optimum blade length of a wind turbine blade structure is developed in this research.

Fuel Slosh

PI Sathya Gangadharan

2014 marks the eleventh year of Fuel Slosh studies that have been carried out at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Initially funded by NASA Graduate Student Research Program (GSRP) along with Southwest Research Institute, the research was started by Keith Schlee, a graduate student, under the guidance of Dr. Sathya Gangadharan, professor at Embry-Riddle.

Read more

The research involved extensive theoretical and computational analysis. A fuel slosh test rig was set up at the structures lab for the students and researchers to conduct various experiments and validate their results.This research has evolved from the study of fuel slosh to the effect of diaphragms and baffles on slosh behavior and to the use of smart materials in actively damping the slosh. Tests on effectiveness of damping have also been carried out at NASA's Spinning Slosh Test Rig (SSTR) located at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in San Antonio, Texas. Research works are frequently published at but not limited to American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) and so on.A gist of some of the research works in Fuel Slosh carried out at Embry-Riddle is described below from the previous to the current on-going research:(Note: Only selective research works are mentioned below, for complete list of fuel slosh research works contact Dr. Sathya Gangadharan)

MODELING AND PARAMETER ESTIMATION OF SPACECRAFT FUEL SLOSH MODE

Mission:
The research is directed toward modeling fuel slosh on spinning spacecraft using simple pendulum analogs. The pendulum analog will model a spherical tank with no PMD's. An electric motor will induce the motion of the pendulum to simulate free surface slosh. Parameters describing the simple pendulum models will characterize the modal frequency of the free surface sloshing motion. The one degree of freedom model will help to understand fuel sloshing and serve as a stepping stone for future more complex simulations to predict the NTC accurately with less time and effort.

A CFD APPROACH TO MODELING SPACECRAFT FUEL SLOSH

Mission:
By using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver such as Fluent, a model for this fuel slosh can be created. The accuracy of the model must be tested by comparing its results to an experimental test case. Such a model will allow for the variation of many different parameters such as fluid viscosity and gravitational field, yielding a deeper understanding of spacecraft slosh dynamics.

MODELING OF FREE-SURFACE FUEL SLOSH IN MICROGRAVITY FOR OFF-AXIS SPACECRAFT PROPELLANT TANKS

Mission:
MATLAB SimMechanics fuel slosh model can be used to estimate slosh parameters and predict dynamic effects on dependent systems. Comparative flight data was acquired by spinning a mock spacecraft with partially filled propellant tanks in a microgravity environment. Empirical and simulated NTC's are compared to validate a SimMechanics fuel slosh model.

A COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF SPACECRAFT PROPELLANT TANKS IMPLEMENTED WITH FLEXIBLE DIAPHRAGMS

Mission:
The main objective of this research is to validate computational modeling of fuel slosh scenarios so that it may become the primary means of testing fuel slosh scenarios during initial spacecraft design. By expanding on past research objectives, this research aims at complementing the pre-existing data with new data from added computational and experimental simulations. Additionally, this research aims at conducting an extensive study of the computational fuel slosh models used in this investigation. The current research investigation presents detailed results of the fluid behavior within the tank and initiates an even more extensive investigation of fluid behavior for future fuel slosh research studies at ERAU.

AN INVESTIGATION OF BAFFLES AND ASPERITIES ON SLOSH BEHAVIOR IN PROPELLANT TANKS OF SPACECRAFT AND LAUNCH VEHICLES

Mission:
The focus of this research is to investigate the fuel slosh behavior in propellant tanks. Different types of baffles and hemispherical asperities are introduced inside the tank to characterize the slosh behavior of the fluid. The modeling and the analysis of slosh is done using the CFD solver ANSYS CFX for tanks with and without baffles and for tanks with hemispherical asperities. Physical models are fabricated for experimental testing using the fuel slosh test facility at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. Using the single axis linear actuator and fuel tank set up in the test facility, experimental results are obtained with and without baffles. The experiment and CFD modeling results are compared.

SLOSH DAMPING WITH FLOATING ELECTRO-ACTIVE MICRO-BAFFLES

Mission:
Embedding floating micro-baffles with an electro-active material such that the baffle can be manipulated when exposed to a magnetic field preserves the benefits of both floating and static baffle designs. Activated micro-baffles form a rigid layer at the free surface and provide a restriction of the fluid motion. Proposed micro-baffle design and magnetic activation source method along with proof-of-concept experiments comparing the scope of this research to previous PMD methods are presented. A computational fluid dynamics approach is outlined. Preliminary proof-of-concept testing indicates floating electro-active micro-baffles reduce the damping time of sloshing by up to 88% as compared to the same slosh condition with the absence of any PMDs
.

DEVELOPMENT OF A MAGNETOSTRICTIVE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT DEVICE (MSPMD) FOR HYBRID ACTIVE SLOSH DAMPING IN SPACECRAFT APPLICATION

Mission:
To study the use of a hybrid Magnetostrictive membrane as a Magnetostrictive Propellant Management Device (MSPMD) to actively control the free surface effect and reduce fuel slosh.. The viability of merging existing diaphragm membrane aka Propellant management device (PMD) with a magnetostrictive inlay embedded with the Terfenol-D matrix / MR-Fluid allows us to actively control the membrane during in-flight conditions. Apart from the development, analysis on the control of the hybrid active membrane and the use of the same to dampen fuel slosh is also performed in order to establish the proof of concept. During the development process of the hybrid active membrane, the geometric dependency of the meta-smart structure is analyzed to optimize the membrane shape, size and material.
