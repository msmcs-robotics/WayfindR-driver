Profile

Welcome to the Embry-Riddle College of Engineering!

I’m honored and delighted to be leading the College of Engineering at the world’s preeminent aeronautical university. On our Daytona Beach campus and this webpage, you’ll hear about students, faculty, staff and alumni who are reimagining the future of engineering and developing solutions to the world’s most pressing problems.

Embry-Riddle Eagles are innovators. Our college community is building a
camera system
that will take the first-ever third-person view of a spacecraft making an extraterrestrial landing. We’re also advancing research on
earthquake-resilient buildings
, modeling
human movement
to reduce the spread of illness, investigating
new manufacturing approaches
, helping to define pilot interfaces for new air taxi designs and much more.

When students pursue an Embry-Riddle degree in one of our Engineering programs, they enter a supportive learning community enhanced by cutting-edge technology and innovative curriculum. Our faculty challenges students to connect their classroom learning to research and hands-on projects, while facilities like the Eagle Flight Research Center and MicaPlex equip students with the competencies of today and tomorrow. Our close relationships with industry and our alumni ensure that students enter the workforce with the knowledge and skills necessary to flourish.

From high-performing extracurricular teams like
Design, Build, Fly
and
RobotX
to student-designed space technology, students who choose Embry-Riddle have no shortage of opportunities. At Embry-Riddle, we pursue excellence in engineering education and research — on earth, in space and beyond.

Warmly,

Dr. James Gregory

Dean, College of Engineering
