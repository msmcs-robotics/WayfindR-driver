The
Department of Mechanical Engineering
programs at Embry-Riddle provide a strong foundation in all of the fundamental areas of Mechanical Engineering, along with focused tracks in areas of rapid employment growth, such as high-performance vehicles, biomedical systems, energy systems, and robots and autonomous systems.

Mechanical engineering is the broadest of the engineering professions, involving work in almost every technical area and in a wide variety of industries and organizations. It is also among the most enduring professional careers, with stable job opportunities during difficult economic periods.

The Department offers a
Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering
, a
Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering
and a
Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering
.

The undergraduate program gives students a solid background in the basic mechanical engineering subjects so they can plan, analyze, design, build and test mechanical systems, including those in high-performance vehicles, energy and power, biomedical systems, and robotics. Coursework is designed to give students a chance to work in teams and explore the breadth of engineering topics. Mechanical engineering is also unique on campus by requiring students to complete a co-op or internship (or equivalent) to gain real-world engineering experience.

The graduate programs in Mechanical Engineering expand on the bachelor’s degree with advanced studies in engineering, including both Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees. Students in these programs gain deeper insight into engineering while gaining experience with research and earning degrees that are highly sought after in industry.
