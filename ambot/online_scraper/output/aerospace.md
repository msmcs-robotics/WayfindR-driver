The Aerospace Engineering department is the largest of its kind in the country, with 2,322 Bachelor of Science students, 93 Master of Science students and 72 Ph.D. students as of Fall 2024. Of our undergraduate students, about 10% are
honors students
compared to about 5% for the rest of the university. The undergraduate program had been ranked No. 1 by "U.S. News and World Report" from 2000-2015 when the Daytona campus was classified among non-Ph.D.-granting institutions. Since being reclassified into the Ph.D.-granting category in 2016, it has been ranked in the top 5 for three of the last five years. Currently, our program ranks No. 5 in the country, above some elite Aerospace Engineering programs, and No. 1 in the state of Florida. Our graduate program started being ranked only in 2016 and is currently ranked 28th in the nation and No. 2 in the state of Florida. Our department strives to provide a diverse and inclusive environment for all students. Currently, we have 26% female students and 24% underrepresented minorities in our B.S. program, which is higher than the national average for Aerospace Engineering programs.

Aerospace Engineering deals with the scientific principles that govern the design of airplanes, spacecraft, and jet engines. After studying fundamental mathematics and physics, Aerospace Engineering students study the core areas of aerodynamics and propulsion, dynamics and control, and structures and materials. These studies give them the necessary background to take the year-long senior capstone aircraft/spacecraft/propulsion design courses. There are ample opportunities for lab courses and hands-on experiences.

Embry-Riddle is known throughout the aviation and aerospace industry as the top provider of hands-on, pragmatic education, producing engineers who are ready to solve the real-world problems encountered by the aerospace industry. A recent (2021-22) alumni survey showed that 91% of graduates were either employed (77%) or accepted into graduate school (14%) one year after graduation.

Our students have been involved in many interesting projects, including AIAA Design Built Fly competitions, where they have placed in the top three the last three years. Our
research activities
have been increasing, with research expenditures more than tripling over the past five years, and our faculty and students are involved in many
research projects
.

The department also offers several graduate degrees as well as an accelerated program. The recent addition of a
Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering
increases opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students alike to pursue new and advanced knowledge to reinforce and enhance the classroom experience.

The Department of Aerospace Engineering is housed in the Lehman Engineering and Technology Center, and the John Mica Engineering & Aerospace Innovation Complex. Both of these facilities provide ample
laboratory space
for students and
faculty
to explore modern
research questions
in aerospace together.
