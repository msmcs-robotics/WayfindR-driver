The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University – Daytona Beach Campus is now accepting applications for the 2023-2024 National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships to Accelerate Graduates in Engineering for STEM (SAGE-STEM) project.

Overview

Embry-Riddle’s Daytona Beach, FL, campus is proud to announce its NSF-funded SAGE-STEM project. This project aims to deliver financial scholarship support to domestic, low-income, high-achieving students who demonstrate financial need at Embry-Riddle. This scholarship will be provided to students that pursue four-year bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science, Software Engineering or Computer Engineering followed by a one-year accelerated master’s degree in one of the following areas: Software Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, or Cybersecurity Engineering. The project will provide scholarships for up to five years to support the completion of undergraduate and master’s degrees. The scholarships are funded through a grant awarded by the NSF.

Embry-Riddle SAGE-STEM is a unique project designed to recruit, train and support the next generation of professionals in the above-mentioned STEM fields. In addition to graduating talented students with bachelor’s and master’s degrees in STEM, the uniqueness of this program lies in the creation of a supporting ecosystem that will build around qualified scholars and combines evidence-based practices such as faculty mentoring, academic advising, participation in the learning community, professional development activities, guidance in acquiring internships and research opportunities. The overall goal of this project is to increase undergraduate and graduate STEM degree completion of domestic, low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need in the STEM field.
